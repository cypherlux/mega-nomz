# Mega Nomz


## Overview
This recipe app will help me do the following:
1) Search through recipes I have saved by:
- ingredients
- macros, calories, nutrients
- cuisine
- type (ex: soup, stirfry)
- meal prep-ability
- other qualities (hot, cold, comfort, healthy, light)
- pictures!!
2) Add more recipes:
- manually, using a form sorta thing
- via a URL to one already on the web yayyyyyy ([inspo](https://github.com/hhursev/recipe-scrapers))

## Inspiration
I like to cook, but sometimes I get stuck in a rut. I'd like an easy way that I can look for meals to make that I know are already bomb af. I could imagine me being restless and just needing to scroll through images into something looks delicious. Or perhaps it's the 13th week in a row that I've gotten carrots in my farm box, and I want to look for a recipe that I've used carrots in before but have forgotten about. Orrrr maybe I have a random ingredient (i.e. mint leaves) that I want to whip up into something tasty.

## Front-end
On the front-end, I plan to use HTML, CSS, Javascript. Maybe I'll throw in some React. Idk yet.

Features:
- searchable
- can add to shopping list

## Back-end
In the backend, I'll need:
- a database
- a web scraper (idk why but I wanna use Python)

### Searchable things
The database will have to store a fuck ton of stuff, such as:
- name
- link and/or source
- photo
- unordered list of ingredients
- ordered instructions
- cuisine type (ex: mexican, korean, america, etc.)
- hot / cold
- nutritional facts (by using [edamam api](https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api-demo)?
- general type of meal (bowl, stirfry, pasta, smoothie)
- meal type (breakfast, lunch/dinner, snack, dessert)
- meal prepable (True or False probably, i.e. can I make this ahead of time and freeze it?)
